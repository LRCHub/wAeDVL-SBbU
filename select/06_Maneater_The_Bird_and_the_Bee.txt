She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed
By the purr of a jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man, and
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
